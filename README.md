<ins>**v0.4.3 - Dusk till dawn**</ins>

**Reduce the necessity of an external utility:**
- Make effects counters decrease during the day in both reset message and /list command.
- Show the amount of remaining available points in the day
- Show the remaining neccessary participations/wins to obtain the daily hint/streak bonuses

**Balancing features:**
- ~~Make more difficult to obtain both partecipation and activity bonus~~
- ~~Reduce the neccessary activity streak for the first bonus and nerf all of them.~~
- ~~Introduce more levels of hint based on partecipation grades.~~
- (TBD) Players tied on points, it may no longer be appropriate to establish a tiebreaker based on the number of participations.

**Quality of Life features:**
- Enchance the daily before-reset message showing even gained/losed position in the leaderboard from the previous day.

**Documentation:**
- ~~Update /alias with the newly sets and events introduced.~~

**Security:**
- ~~Use OpenRoot() for os operation on file to ensure safeness on the host machine.~~

**Other:**
- Add an expiration date to each reload file to prevent it from being reloaded after that date.
